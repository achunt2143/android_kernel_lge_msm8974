	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about VIA devices. If you say Y, you will be asked for
	  your specific card in the following questions.

	  If you have a VIA "Rhine" based network card (Rhine-I (VT86C100A),
	  Rhine-II (VT6102), or Rhine-III (VT6105)), say Y here. Rhine-type
	  Ethernet functions can also be found integrated on South Bridges
	  (e.g. VT8235).

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module
	  will be called via-rhine.

	  This instructs the driver to use PCI shared memory (MMIO) instead of
	  programmed I/O ports (PIO). Enabling this gives an improvement in
	  processing time in parts of the driver.

	  If unsure, say Y.
