	  Writes to the virtual block device are not immediately written to the

	  Linux 'Virtual Machine' uses a journalling filesystem and the host

          Synchronous operation (i.e. always writing data to the host's disk

          kernel command line option.  Alternatively, you can say Y here to
          turn on synchronous operation by default for all block devices.

          If you're running a journalling file system (like reiserfs, for

	  Saying Y here will allow you to use a regular file as a block
	  device; you can then create a file system on that block device and
	  mount it just as you would mount other block devices such as hard
	  drive partitions, CD-ROM drives or floppy drives. The loop devices
	  are block special device files with major number 7 and typically
	  called /dev/loop0, /dev/loop1 etc.

	  This is useful if you want to check an ISO 9660 file system before
	  burning the CD, or if you want to use floppy images without first
	  writing them to floppy. Furthermore, some Linux distributions avoid
	  the need for a dedicated Linux partition by keeping their complete
	  root file system inside a DOS FAT file using this loop device
	  driver.

	  To use the loop device, you need the losetup utility, found in the

	  The loop device driver can also be used to "hide" a file system in
	  a disk partition, floppy, or regular file, either using encryption
	  (scrambling the data) or steganography (hiding the data in the low
	  bits of, say, a sound file). This is also safe if the file resides
	  on a remote file server.

<<<<<<< HEAD
	  There are several ways of encrypting disks. Some of these require
	  kernel patches. The vanilla kernel offers the cryptoloop option

	  This is the virtual block driver for virtio.  It can be used with
          QEMU based VMMs (like KVM or Xen).  Say Y or M.

	  Say Y here if you want include the Rados block device, which stripes
	  a block device over objects stored in the Ceph distributed object
	  store.

	  More information at http://ceph.newdream.net/.

	  If unsure, say N.

config BLK_DEV_UBLK

	select IO_URING
	help
	  io_uring based userspace block driver. Together with ublk server, ublk
	  has been working well, but interface with userspace or command data
	  definition isn't finalized yet, and might change according to future
	  requirement, so mark is as experimental now.

	  Say Y if you want to get better performance because task_work_add()
	  can be used in IO path for replacing io_uring cmd, which will become
	  shared between IO tasks and ubq daemon, meantime task_work_add() can
	  can handle batch more effectively, but task_work_add() isn't exported
	  for module, so ublk has to be built to kernel.

config BLKDEV_UBLK_LEGACY_OPCODES
	bool "Support legacy command opcode"
	depends on BLK_DEV_UBLK
	default y
	help
	  ublk driver started to take plain command encoding, which turns out
	  one bad way. The traditional ioctl command opcode encodes more
	  info and basically defines each code uniquely, so opcode conflict
	  is avoided, and driver can handle wrong command easily, meantime it
	  may help security subsystem to audit io_uring command.

	  Say Y if your application still uses legacy command opcode.

	  Say N if you don't want to support legacy command opcode. It is
	  suggested to enable N if your application(ublk server) switches to
	  ioctl command encoding.
