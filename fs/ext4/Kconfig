	  This is the next generation of the ext3 filesystem.

	  Unlike the change from ext2 filesystem to ext3 filesystem,
	  the on-disk format of ext4 is not forwards compatible with
	  ext3; it is based on extent maps and it supports 48-bit
	  physical block numbers.  The ext4 filesystem also supports delayed
	  allocation, persistent preallocation, high resolution time stamps,
	  and a number of other features to improve performance and speed
	  up fsck time.  For more information, please see the web pages at
	  http://ext4.wiki.kernel.org.

<<<<<<< HEAD
	  The ext4 filesystem will support mounting an ext3
	  filesystem; while there will be some performance gains from
	  the delayed allocation and inode table readahead, the best
	  performance gains will require enabling ext4 features in the
	  filesystem, or formatting a new filesystem as an ext4
	  filesystem initially.
=======
	  The ext4 filesystem supports mounting an ext3 filesystem; while there
	  are some performance gains from the delayed allocation and inode
	  table readahead, the best performance gains require enabling ext4
	  features in the filesystem using tune2fs, or formatting a new
	  filesystem as an ext4 filesystem initially. Without explicit enabling
	  of ext4 features, the on disk filesystem format stays fully backward
	  compatible.
