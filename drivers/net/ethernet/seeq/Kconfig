	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about SEEQ devices. If you say Y, you will be asked for
	  your specific card in the following questions.

	  If you have an Acorn system with one of these network cards, you
	  should say Y to this option if you wish to use it with Linux.

	  This is a driver for the SEEQ 8005 network (Ethernet) card.  If this
	  is for you, read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module
	  will be called seeq8005.

	  Say Y here if you have an Seeq based Ethernet network card. This is
	  used in many Silicon Graphics machines.
