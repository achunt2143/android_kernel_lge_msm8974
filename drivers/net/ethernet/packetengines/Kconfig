	  Say Y here if you have a Packet Engines G-NIC PCI Gigabit Ethernet
	  adapter or the SYM53C885 Ethernet controller. The Gigabit adapter is
	  used by the Beowulf Linux cluster project.  See
	  <http://cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov/linux/drivers/yellowfin.html> for more
	  information about this driver in particular and Beowulf in general.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called yellowfin.  This is recommended.
