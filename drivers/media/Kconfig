	   Configuring the media subsystem can be complex, as there are
	   hundreds of drivers and other config options.

	   This menu offers option that will help the Kernel's config
	   system to hide drivers that are out of the scope of the
	   user needs, and disabling core support for unused APIs.

	   If not selected, all non-optional media core functionality
	   needed to support media drivers will be enabled. Also, all
	   media device drivers should be shown.

	default y if MEDIA_SUPPORT_FILTER
	help
	  By default, a media driver auto-selects all possible ancillary
	  devices such as tuners, sensors, video encoders/decoders and
	  frontends, that are used by any of the supported devices.

	  This is generally the right thing to do, except when there
	  are strict constraints with regards to the kernel size,
	  like on embedded systems.

	  Use this option with care, as deselecting ancillary drivers which
	  are, in fact, necessary will result in the lack of the needed
	  functionality for your device (it may not tune or may not have
	  the needed demodulators).

	  If unsure say Y.
