	  performance overhead.

config SND_CTL_DEBUG

	  Say Y to enable the debugging feature for ALSA control API.
	  It performs the additional sanity-checks for each control element
	  read access, such as whether the values returned from the driver
	  are in the proper ranges or the check of the invalid access at
	  out-of-array areas.  The error is printed when the driver gives
