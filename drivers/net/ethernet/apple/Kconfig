	  Power Macintoshes and clones with Ethernet built-in on the
	  motherboard will usually use a MACE (Medium Access Control for
	  Ethernet) interface. Say Y to include support for the MACE chip.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called mace.

	  Some Apple machines (notably the Apple Network Server) which use the
	  MACE ethernet chip have an Apple AUI port (small 15-pin connector),
	  instead of an 8-pin RJ45 connector for twisted-pair ethernet.  Say
	  Y here if you have such a machine.  If unsure, say N.
	  The driver will default to AAUI on ANS anyway, and if you use it as
	  a module, you can provide the port_aaui=0|1 to force the driver.
