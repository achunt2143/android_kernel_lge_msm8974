	  Ext2 is a standard Linux file system for hard disks.

	  This filesystem driver is deprecated because it does not properly
	  support inode time stamps beyond 03:14:07 UTC on 19 January 2038.

	  Ext2 users are advised to use ext4 driver to access their filesystem.
	  The driver is fully compatible, supports filesystems without journal
          or extents, and also supports larger time stamps if the filesystem
          is created with at least 256 byte inodes.

	  This code is kept as a simple reference for filesystem developers.

	  If unsure, say N.
