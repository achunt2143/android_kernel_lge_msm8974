	  the questions about Adaptec cards. If you say Y, you will be asked for
	  your specific card in the following questions.

	  Say Y here if you have an Adaptec Starfire (or DuraLAN) PCI network
	  adapter. The DuraLAN chip is used on the 64 bit PCI boards from
	  Adaptec e.g. the ANA-6922A. The older 32 bit boards use the tulip
	  driver.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called starfire.  This is recommended.
