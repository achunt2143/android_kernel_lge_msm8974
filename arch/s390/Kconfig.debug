config STRICT_DEVMEM
	def_bool y
	prompt "Filter access to /dev/mem"
	---help---
	  This option restricts access to /dev/mem.  If this option is
	  disabled, you allow userspace access to all memory, including
	  kernel and userspace memory. Accidental memory access is likely
	  to be disastrous.
	  Memory access is required for experts who want to debug the kernel.

	  If you are unsure, say Y.

config DEBUG_STRICT_USER_COPY_CHECKS
	def_bool n
	prompt "Strict user copy size checks"
	---help---
	  Enabling this option turns a certain set of sanity checks for user
	  copy operations into compile time warnings.

	  The copy_from_user() etc checks are there to help test if there
	  are sufficient security checks on the length argument of
	  the copy operation, by having gcc prove that the argument is
	  within bounds.

	  If unsure, or if you run an older (pre 4.4) gcc, say N.

config DEBUG_ENTRY
	bool "Debug low-level entry code"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  This option enables sanity checks in s390 low-level entry code.
	  Some of these sanity checks may slow down kernel entries and
	  exits or otherwise impact performance.

	  If unsure, say N.

config CIO_INJECT
	bool "CIO Inject interfaces"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL && DEBUG_FS
	help
	  This option provides a debugging facility to inject certain artificial events
	  and instruction responses to the CIO layer of Linux kernel. The newly created
	  debugfs user-interfaces will be at /sys/kernel/debug/s390/cio/*
