	  This is a file system used on some CD-ROMs and DVDs. Since the
	  file system is supported by multiple operating systems and is more
	  compatible with standard unix file systems, it is also suitable for
	  removable USB disks. Say Y if you intend to mount DVD discs or CDRW's
	  written in packet mode, or if you want to use UDF for removable USB
	  disks. Please read <file:Documentation/filesystems/udf.rst>.

	  To compile this file system support as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called udf.

	  If unsure, say N.
