	  This driver supports the "hme" interface present on most Ultra
	  systems and as an option on older Sbus systems. This driver supports
	  both PCI and Sbus devices. This driver also supports the "qfe" quad
	  100baseT device available in both PCI and Sbus configurations.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called sunhme.
