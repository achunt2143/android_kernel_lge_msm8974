	  Link Access Procedure, Balanced (LAPB) is the data link layer (i.e.
	  the lower) part of the X.25 protocol. It offers a reliable
	  connection service to exchange data frames with one other host, and
	  it is used to transport higher level protocols (mostly X.25 Packet
	  Layer, the higher part of X.25, but others are possible as well).
	  Usually, LAPB is used with specialized X.21 network cards, but Linux
	  currently supports LAPB only over Ethernet connections. If you want
	  to use LAPB connections over Ethernet, say Y here and to "LAPB over
	  Ethernet driver" below. Read

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called lapb.  If unsure, say N.
