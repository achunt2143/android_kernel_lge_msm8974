	  Saying Y here will allow you to use Linux in text mode through a
	  display that complies with the generic VGA standard. Virtually
	  everyone wants that.

	  The program SVGATextMode can be used to utilize SVGA video cards to
	  their full potential in text mode. Download it from
	  <ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/utils/console/>.

	  Say Y.

       default n
       help
         The scrollback buffer of the standard VGA console is located in
	 the VGA RAM.  The size of this RAM is fixed and is quite small.
	 If you require a larger scrollback buffer, this can be placed in
	 System RAM which is dynamically allocated during initialization.
	 Placing the scrollback buffer in System RAM will slightly slow
	 down the console.

	 If you want this feature, say 'Y' here and enter the amount of
	 RAM to allocate for this buffer.  If unsure, say 'N'.

	  Say Y here if you have an old MDA or monochrome Hercules graphics
	  adapter in your system acting as a second head ( = video card). You
	  will then be able to use two monitors with your Linux system. Do not
	  say Y here if your MDA card is the primary card in your system; the
	  normal VGA driver will handle it.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called mdacon.

	  This option enables the fbcon (framebuffer text-based) hardware

	  On modern machines, on mainstream machines (like x86-64) or when
	  using a modern Linux distribution those fbdev drivers usually aren't used.
	  So enabling this option wouldn't have any effect, which is why you want
	  to disable this option on such newer machines.

	  If you compile this kernel for older machines which still require the
	  fbdev drivers, you may want to say Y.

	  If unsure, select n.

	  Note that the answer to this question won't directly affect the

	  the questions about foreign fonts.

	  This is the "high resolution" font for the VGA frame buffer (the one
	  provided by the text console 80x50 (and higher) modes).

	  Note that this is a poor quality font. The VGA 8x16 font is quite a
