	help
	  This option builds in test cases for the device tree infrastructure
	  that are executed once at boot time, and the results dumped to the
	  console.

	  This option should only be enabled for a development kernel. The tests
	  will taint the kernel with TAINT_TEST. The tests will cause ERROR and
	  WARNING messages to print on the console. The tests will cause stack
	  traces to print on the console.  It is possible that the tests will
	  leave the devicetree in a corrupted state.

	  The unittest output will be verbose.  Copy the output to a file
	  via capturing the console output or via the dmesg command.  Process
	  this file with scripts/dtc/of_unittest_expect to reduce the
	  verbosity, test whether expected output is present, and to
	  summarize the results.

	  If unsure, say N here. This option is not safe to enable.
