	help
	  Say Y or M here to include support for RxRPC session sockets (just
	  the transport part, not the presentation part: (un)marshalling is
	  left to the application).

	  These are used for AFS kernel filesystem and userspace utilities.

	  This module at the moment only supports client operations and is
	  currently incomplete.

	  Say Y here to allow AF_RXRPC to use IPV6 UDP as well as IPV4 UDP as
	  its network transport.

config AF_RXRPC_INJECT_LOSS

	  Say Y here to inject packet loss by discarding some received and some
	  transmitted packets.

	bool "Inject delay into packet reception"
	depends on SYSCTL
	help
	  Say Y here to inject a delay into packet reception, allowing an
	  extended RTT time to be modelled.  The delay can be configured using
	  /proc/sys/net/rxrpc/rxrpc_inject_rx_delay, setting a number of
	  milliseconds up to 0.5s (note that the granularity is actually in
	  jiffies).
